at very early stage of development. nothing works except copying file
from one directory to another.

create certificates for TLS connection.

  $ python3 ca.py

check if these certificates work

start a server in one terminal

  $ python3 tls/server.py 9999

start a client in another

  $ python3 tls/client.py 9999

the server will print b'hello'

check if in-memory test works

  $ python3 tls/fake.py

check if modification to TLS protocol works

  $ python3 tls/peer.py


start tracker

  $ python3 tracker.py 10000

start one peer

  $ python3 client.py 9999 /tmp/blackout/a

start another peer

  $ python3 client.py 9998 /tmp/blackout/b

create a new file

  $ echo "hello" > /tmp/blackout/a/cur/00

in a few seconds, we will find 00 under /tmp/blackout/b/cur
